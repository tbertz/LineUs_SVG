# LineUs_SVG
Simple SVG plotter for the LineUs drawbot originally made with Processing 2.2.1 and Geomerative Plugin now updated for Processing 3 and forked to take account of additional work to basic UI elements using Interfacia http://interfascia.berg.industries/ and quite a bit of bug fixing.

## Usage:
You can simply open the code in [Processing 3](https://processing.org/download/), install the Geomerative plugin (via Tools > Add Tool) and run the sketch.

Once tested and stable a build application will be made available.

_Key Shortcuts:_
* open SVG: o
* zoom: +/-
* move: arrow keys <>
* rotate: r
